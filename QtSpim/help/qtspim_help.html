<h1><a name="qtspim">QtSpim</a></h1>
<p><i>QtSpim</i> is a self-contained simulator that will run a MIPS32 
assembly program and display the processor's registers 
and memory.</p>

<p><i>QtSpim</i> reads and executes programs written in <span class="style1">assembly</span> language for 
a MIPS computer.
<i>QtSpim</i> does <u>not</u> execute binary (compiled) programs. To simplify 
programming, <i>QtSpim</i> provides a simple debugger and 
small set of operating system services.</p>

<p><i>QtSpim</i> implements most of the MIPS32 assembler-extended instruction 
set. (It omits the floating point comparisons and rounding modes and the memory 
system page tables.) The MIPS architecture has several variants that differ in various 
ways (e.g., the MIPS64 architecture supports 64-bit integers and addresses), which 
means that <i>QtSpim</i> will not run programs for all MIPS processors.</p>

<h2><a name="getting">Getting Started with QtSpim</a></h2>
<p>When <i>QtSpim</i> starts up, it opens a window containing that looks like 
the one below. (The features in the window look slightly different on Microsoft 
Windows than on Linux or Mac OSX, but all the menus and buttons are in the same place and work 
the same way).</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<img alt="QtSpim Main Window" height="700" src="main_windows.jpg" class="style2"></p>

<p><i>QtSpim</i>'s main window has three parts:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The narrow pane on the left can display integer or floating-point 
	registers. Select the set of registers by clicking the tab at the 
	top of the pane.</li>
	<li>The wide pane on the right can display the text segment, which contains 
	instructions, and the data segments. Choose between text and data by 
	clicking the tab at the top of the pane.</li>
	<li>The small pane on the bottom is where <i>QtSpim</i> writes its messages.</li>
</ol>
All of the panes are dockable, which means that you can grab a pane by its top bar and
drag it out of <i>QtSpim</i>'s main window, to put on some other part of your 
screen.

<p><i>QtSpim</i> also opens another window called Console that displays output from your program.</p>

<h2><a name="loading">Loading a Program</a></h2>

<p>Your program should be stored in a file. Assembly code files usually have the extension ".s", as in 
<span class="style3">file1.s</span>.
To load a file, go to the <strong>File</strong> menu and select <strong>Load File</strong>. The 
screen will change as the file is loaded, to show the
instructions and data in your program.</p>

<p>Another very useful command on the <strong>File</strong> men is <strong>Reinitialize and Load File</strong>. It first clears all changes made by a program,
including deleting all of its instructions, and then reloads the last file. This command 
works well when debugging a program, as
you can change your program and quickly test it in a fresh computer without closing and restarting <i>QtSpim</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="running">Running a Program</a></h2>

<p>To start a program running after you have loaded it, go to the <strong>Simulator</strong> menu and click 
<strong>Run/Continue</strong>. Your program will run
until it finishes or until an error occurs. Either way, you will see the changes that your program 
made to the MIPS registers and
memory, and the output your program writes will appear in the Console window.</p>

<p>If your program does not work correctly, there are several things you can do. The easiest is to single step between instructions,
which lets you see the changes each instructions makes, one at a time. This command is also on the 
<strong>Simulator</strong> menu and is named
<strong>Single Step</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, you need to run your program for a while before something goes wrong, and single stepping would 
be too slow.
<i>QtSpim</i> lets you set a breakpoint at a specific instruction, which stops <i>QtSpim</i> before the instruction executes.
So, if you think your problem is in a specific function in your program, set a breakpoint at the first instruction in the function,
and <i>QtSpim</i> will stop everytime the function is invoked.</p>
<p>You set a breakpoint by right-clicking on the instruction where you
want to stop, and selecting <strong>Set Breakpoint</strong>. When you are done with the breakpoint, you can remove it by selecting 
<strong>Clear Breakpoint</strong>
instead.</p>
<p>If you want to stop your program while it is running, go to the <strong>Simulator</strong> menu and click 
<strong>Pause</strong>. This command stops your program, let you look around, and continue execution if you want. If you do not want to continue 
running, click <strong>Stop</strong> instead.</p>
<p>When <i>QtSpim</i> stops, either because of an error in your program, a breakpoint, after clicking 
<strong>Pause</strong>, or after single stepping, you can continue the
program running by clicking on <strong>Run/Continue</strong> (or you can continue single stepping by clicking 
<strong>Single Step</strong>). If you click <strong>Stop</strong>,
instead of <strong>Pause</strong>, then clicking <strong>Run/Continue</strong> will restart your program from the beginning, instead of continuing from where
it stopped. (This is roughly the same way that a music player operates; you can 
pause and restart a song, but if you stop the music, you need to start playing 
at the beginning.)</p>

<h2><a name="display">Display Options</a></h2>

<p>The three other menus -- <strong>Registers</strong>, <strong>Text Segment</strong>, and 
<strong>Data Segment</strong> -- control <i>QtSpim</i>'s displays. For example, the
<strong>Register</strong> menu controls the way <i>QtSpim</i> displays the contents of registers, 
either in binary, base 8 (octal), base 10 (decimal), or base 16 (hexadecimal).
It is often quite convenient to flip between these representations to understand 
your data.</p>

<p>These menus also let you turn off the display of various parts of the machine, which can help reduce clutter on the screen and
let you concentrate on the parts of the program or data that really matter.</p>

<h2><a name="changing">Changing Registers and Memory</a></h2>
<p>You can change the contents of either a register or memory location by 
right-clicking on it and selecting <strong>Change Register Contents</strong> or
<strong>Change Memory Contents</strong>, respectively.</p>
<h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>

<p>The <strong>Simulator</strong> menu contains the <strong>Settings</strong> command, which brings up a dialog like this:</p>

<p><img alt="QtSpim settings dialog" height="500" src="settings_dialog.jpg" class="style2" ></p>

<p>The dialog has two tabs. The first, shown above, changes the visual aspects of <i>QtSpim</i>, such as the fonts. 
The second looks like this:</p>
<p>
<img alt="QtSpim Settings Dialog" height="500" src="settings_dialog2.jpg" class="style2" ></p>
<p>It changes the way that <i>QtSpim</i> operates:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bare machine</strong> make <i>QtSpim</i> simulate a bare MIPS 
	processor.</li>
	<li><strong>Accept pseudo instructions</strong> enables <i>QtSpim</i> to 
	accept assembly instructions that MIPS does not actually execute, to make 
	programming easier.</li>
	<li><strong>Enable delayed branches</strong> causes <i>QtSpim</i> to execute 
	the instruction immediateyafter a branch instruction before transfering 
	control and to calculate the new PC 
	from the address of this next instruction.</li>
	<li><strong>Enable delayed loads</strong> causes <i>QtSpim</i> to delay the 
	value loaded from memory for one instruction after the load 
	instructions.</li>
	<li><strong>Enable mapped IO</strong> turns on memory-mapped IO.</li>
</ul>
<p>The button marked <strong>Simple Machine</strong> enables the most common options (<strong>Accept 
Pseudo Instructions</strong>) that are what most people use. The button marked 
<strong>Bare 
Machine</strong> turns on the instructions corresponding to a real MIPS processor (<strong>Bare 
Machine</strong>, <strong>Delayed Branches</strong>, <strong>Delayed Loads</strong>).</p>
