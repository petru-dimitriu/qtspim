    <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
        <p>Encoding instructions as binary numbers is natural and efficient for computers.
        Humans, however, have a great deal of difficulty understanding and manipulating
        these numbers. People read and write symbols (words) much better than long sequences
        of digits. Chapter 2 showed that we need not choose between numbers and words
        because computer instructions can be represented in many ways. Humans can write
        and read symbols, and computers can execute the equivalent binary numbers. This
        appendix describes the process by which a human-readable program is translated
        into a form that a computer can execute, provides a few hints about writing
        assembly programs, and explains how to run these programs on SPIM, a simulator
        that executes MIPS programs. UNIX, Windows, and Mac OS X versions of the SPIM
        simulator are available on the CD.</p>

<div class="body">
        <p><i>Assembly language</i> is the symbolic representation of a computer’s binary
        encoding— <dfn class="define">machine language</dfn>. Assembly language
        is more readable than machine language because it uses symbols instead of bits.
        The symbols in assembly language name commonly occurring bit patterns, such
        as opcodes and register specifiers, so people can read and remember them. In
        addition, assembly language permits programmers to use <i>labels</i> to identify
        and name particular memory words that hold instructions or data.</p>
        <img class="hpfig" src="Fig1_1.jpg" height="250"><p><b>Figure 1.1 The process that produces
        an executable file.</b> An assembler translates a file of assembly language into
        an object file, which is linked with other files and libraries into an executable
        file.</p>
        <p>A tool called an <dfn class="define">assembler</dfn> translates assembly language
        into binary instructions. Assemblers provide a friendlier representation than a
        computer’s 0s and 1s that simplifies writing and reading programs. Symbolic names for
        operations and locations are one facet of this representation. Another facet is
        programming facilities that increase a program’s clarity. For
        example, <dfn class="define">macros</dfn>, discussed earlier, enable a programmer to
        extend the assembly language by defining new operations.</p>
        <p>An assembler reads a single assembly language <i>source file</i> and produces
        an <i>object file</i> containing machine instructions and bookkeeping information
        that helps combine several object files into a program. Figure 1.1 illustrates
        how a program is built. Most programs consist of several files—also called
        <i>modules</i> — that are written, compiled, and assembled independently. A program
        may also use prewritten routines supplied in a <i>program library </i>. A module
        typically contains <i>references</i> to subroutines and data defined in other
        modules and in libraries. The code in a module cannot be executed when it contains
        <dfn class="define">unresolved references</dfn> to labels in other
        object files or libraries. Another tool, called a <dfn class="define">linker</dfn>,
        combines a collection of object and library files into an <i>executable
        file</i>, which a computer can run.</p>
        <p>To see the advantage of assembly language, consider the following sequence
        of figures, all of which contain a short subroutine that computes and prints
        the sum of the squares of integers from 0 to 100. Figure 1.2 shows the machine
        language that a MIPS computer executes. With considerable effort, you could
        use the opcode and instruction format tables in Chapter 2 to translate the instructions
        into a symbolic program similar to Figure 1.3. This form of the routine is
        much easier to read because operations and operands are written with symbols,
        rather than with bit patterns. However, this assembly language is still difficult
        to follow because memory locations are named by their address, rather than by
        a symbolic label.</p>

        <p><b>Figure 1.2 MIPS machine language code for a routine to compute and print
        the sum of the squares of integers between 0 and 100.</b></p>
        <p>Figure 1.4 shows assembly language that labels memory addresses with mnemonic
        names. Most programmers prefer to read and write this form. Names that begin
        with a period, for example .data and .globl, are <dfn class="define">assembler
        directives</dfn> that tell the assembler how to translate a program but
        do not produce machine instructions. Names followed by a colon, such as str
        or main, are labels that name the next memory location. This program is as readable
        as most assembly language programs (except for a glaring lack of comments),
        but it is still difficult to follow because many simple operations are required
        to accomplish simple tasks and because assembly language’s lack of control flow
        constructs provides few hints about the program’s operation.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the C routine in Figure 1.5 is both shorter and clearer since
        variables have mnemonic names and the loop is explicit rather than constructed
        with branches. In fact, the C routine is the only one that we wrote. The other
        forms of the program were produced by a C compiler and assembler.</p>
        <p>In general, assembly language plays two roles (see Figure 1.6). The first
        role is the output language of compilers. A <i>compiler</i> translates a program
        written in a <i>high-level language</i> (such as C or Pascal) into an equivalent
        program in machine or assembly language. The high-level language is called the
        <dfn class="define">source language</dfn>, and the compiler’s
        output is its <i>target language</i>.</p>

        <p>Assembly language’s other role is as a language in which to write programs.
        This role used to be the dominant one. Today, however, because of larger main
        memories and better compilers, most programmers write in a high-level language
        and rarely, if ever, see the instructions that a computer executes. Nevertheless,
        assembly language is still important to write programs in which speed or size
        are critical or to exploit hardware features that have no analogues in high-level
        languages.</p>
        <p>Although this appendix focuses on MIPS assembly language, assembly programming
        on most other machines is very similar. The additional instructions and address
        modes in CISC machines, such as the VAX, can make assembly programs shorter
        but do not change the process of assembling a program or provide assembly language
        with the advantages of high-level languages such as type-checking and structured

        <h3><a name="when">When to Use Assembly Language</a></h3>
        <p>The primary reason to program in assembly language, as opposed to an available
        high-level language, is that the speed or size of a program is critically important.
        For example, consider a computer that controls a piece of machinery, such as
        a car’s brakes. A computer that is incorporated in another device, such as a
        car, is called an <i>embedded computer</i>. This type of computer needs to respond
        rapidly and predictably to events in the outside world. Because a compiler introduces
        uncertainty about the time cost of operations, programmers may find it difficult
        to ensure that a high-level language program responds within a definite time
        inter-val—say, 1 millisecond after a sensor detects that a tire is skidding.
        An assembly language programmer, on the other hand, has tight control over which
        instructions execute. In addition, in embedded applications, reducing a program’s
        size, so that it fits in fewer memory chips, reduces the cost of the embedded
        computer.</p>
        <pre>
        #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
        int
        main (int argc, char *argv[])
        {
          int i; int sum = 0;
          for (i = 0; i &lt;= 100; i = i + 1) sum = sum + i * i;
          printf (&quot;The sum from 0 .. 100 is %d\n&quot;, sum);
        }
        </pre>
        <p><b>Figure 1.5 The routine written in the C programming language.</b></p>
        <img class="hpfig" src="Fig1_6.jpg" height="200" ><p><b>Figure 1.6 Assembly language
        either is written by a programmer or is the output of a compiler.</b></p>
        <p>A hybrid approach, in which most of a program is written in a high-level language and
        time-critical sections are written in assembly language, builds on the strengths of both
        languages. Programs typically spend most of their time executing a small fraction of the
        program’s source code. This observation is just the principle of locality that
        underlies caches.</p>
        <p>Program profiling measures where a program spends its time and can find the
        time-critical parts of a program. In many cases, this portion of the program
        can be made faster with better data structures or algorithms. Sometimes, however,
        significant performance improvements only come from recoding a critical portion
        of a program in assembly language.</p>
        <p>This improvement is not necessarily an indication that the high-level language’s
        compiler has failed. Compilers typically are better than programmers at producing
        uniformly high-quality machine code across an entire program. Programmers, however,
        understand a program’s algorithms and behavior at a deeper level than a compiler
        and can expend considerable effort and ingenuity improving small sections of
        the program. In particular, programmers often consider several procedures simultaneously
        while writing their code. Compilers typically compile each procedure in isolation
        and must follow strict conventions governing the use of registers at procedure
        boundaries. By retaining commonly used values in registers, even across procedure
        boundaries, programmers can make a program run faster.</p>
        <p>Another major advantage of assembly language is the ability to exploit specialized
        instructions, for example, string copy or pattern-matching instructions. Compilers,
        in most cases, cannot determine that a program loop can be replaced by a single
        instruction. However, the programmer who wrote the loop can replace it easily
        with a single instruction.</p>
        <p>Currently, a programmer’s advantage over a compiler has become difficult
        to maintain as compilation techniques improve and machines’ pipelines increase
        in complexity (Chapter 6).</p>
        <p>The final reason to use assembly language is that no high-level language
        is available on a particular computer. Many older or specialized computers do
        not have a compiler, so a programmer’s only alternative is assembly language.
        </p>
        <h3><a name="drawbacks">Drawbacks of Assembly Language</a></h3>
        <p>Assembly language has many disadvantages that strongly argue against its
        widespread use. Perhaps its major disadvantage is that programs written in assembly
        language are inherently machine-specific and must be totally rewritten to run
        on another computer architecture. The rapid evolution of computers discussed
        in Chapter 1 means that architectures become obsolete. An assembly language
        program remains tightly bound to its original architecture, even after the computer
        is eclipsed by new, faster, and more cost-effective machines.</p>
        <p>Another disadvantage is that assembly language programs are longer than the
        equivalent programs written in a high-level language. For example, the C program
        in Figure 1.5 is 11 lines long, while the assembly program in Figure 1.4
        is 31 lines long. In more complex programs, the ratio of assembly to high-level
        language (its <i>expansion factor</i> ) can be much larger than the factor of
        three in this example. Unfortunately, empirical studies have shown that programmers
        write roughly the same number of lines of code per day in assembly as in high-level
        languages. This means that programmers are roughly <i>x</i> times more productive
        in a high-level language, where <i>x</i> is the assembly language expansion factor.

        <p>To compound the problem, longer programs are more difficult to read and understand

        </i> statements and loops, must be built from branches and jumps. The resulting
        programs are hard to read because the reader must reconstruct every higher-level
        construct from its pieces and each instance of a statement may be slightly different.

        <h4>Elaboration:</h4>
		<p>Compilers can produce machine language directly instead of relying on an
        assembler. These compilers typically execute much faster than those that invoke an
        assembler as part of compilation. However, a compiler that generates machine language
        must perform many tasks that an assembler normally handles, such as resolving addresses
        and encoding instructions as binary numbers. The trade-off is between compilation speed
        and compiler simplicity.</p>
        <h4>Elaboration:</h4>
		<p>Despite these considerations, some embedded applications are written in a high-level
        language. Many of these applications are large and complex programs that must be
        extremely reliable. Assembly language programs are longer and more difficult to write
        and read than high-level language programs. This greatly increases the cost of writing
        an assembly language program and makes it extremely difficult to verify the correctness
        of this type of program. In fact, these considerations led the Department of Defense,
        which pays for many complex embedded systems, to develop Ada, a new high-level language
        for writing embedded systems.</p>

        <h2><a name="assemblers">Assemblers</a></h2>
        <p>An assembler translates a file of assembly language statements into a file
        of binary machine instructions and binary data. The translation process has
        two major parts. The first step is to find memory locations with labels so the
        relationship between symbolic names and addresses is known when instructions
        are translated. The second step is to translate each assembly statement by combining
        the numeric equivalents of opcodes, register specifiers, and labels into a legal
        instruction. As shown in Figure 1.1, the assembler produces an output file,
        called an <i>object file</i>, which contains the machine instructions, data,
        and bookkeeping information.</p>
        <p>An object file typically cannot be executed because it references procedures
        or data in other files. A <dfn class="define">label</dfn> is
        <dfn class="define">external</dfn> (also called
        <dfn class="define">global</dfn>) if the labeled object can be referenced from files
        other than the one in which it is defined. A label is <i>local</i> if the object can be
        used only within the file in which it is defined. In most assemblers, labels are local
        by default and must be explicitly declared global. Subroutines and global variables
        require external labels since they are referenced from many files in a
        program.<dfn class="define">Local labels</dfn> hide names that should not be visible to
        other modules—for example, static functions in C, which can only be called by other
        functions in the same file. In addition, compiler-generated names—for example, a name
        for the instruction at the beginning of a loop—are local so the compiler need not
        produce unique names in every file.</p>
        <h4>Local and Global Labels</h4>
        <p>Consider the program in Figure 1.4. The subroutine has an external (global) label
        main. It also contains two local labels—loop and str—that are only visible with
        this assembly language file. Finally, the routine also contains an unresolved reference
        to an external label printf, which is the library routine that prints values. Which
        labels in Figure 1.4 could be referenced from another file? </p>
        <p>Only global labels are visible outside of a file, so the only label that
        could be referenced from another file is main.</p>
        <p>Since the assembler processes each file in a program individually and in
        isolation, it only knows the addresses of local labels. The assembler depends
        on another tool, the linker, to combine a collection of object files and libraries
        into an executable file by resolving external labels. The assembler assists
        the linker by providing lists of labels and unresolved references.</p>
        <p>However, even local labels present an interesting challenge to an assembler.
        Unlike names in most high-level languages, assembly labels may be used before
        they are defined. In the example, in Figure 1.4, the label str is used by
        the la instruction before it is defined. The possibility of a
        <dfn class="define">forward reference</dfn>, like this forces an
        assembler to translate a program in two steps: first find all labels is used
        before it is defined. and then produce instructions. In the example, when the
        assembler sees the la instruction, it does not know where the word labeled str
        is located or even whether str labels an instruction or datum.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebar">
        <p><dfn class="define">forward reference</dfn> A label that is used
        before it is defined.</p>
        <p><dfn class="define">symbol table</dfn> A table that matches names
        of labels to the addresses of the memory words that instructions occupy.</p>
</div>
<div class="body">
        <p>An assembler’s first pass reads each line of an assembly file and breaks
        it into its component pieces. These pieces, which are called <i>lexemes</i>,
         are individual words, numbers, and punctuation characters. For example, the
        line </p>
        <pre>
        ble $t0, 100, loop
        </pre>
        <p>contains six lexemes: the opcode ble, the register specifier $t0, a comma,
        the number 100, a comma, and the symbol loop.</p>
        <p>If a line begins with a label, the assembler records in its
        <dfn class="define">symbol table</dfn> the name of the label and the
        address of the memory word that the instruction occupies. The assembler then
        calculates how many words of memory the instruction on the current line will
        occupy. By keeping track of the instructions’ sizes, the assembler can determine
        where the next instruction goes. To compute the size of a variable-length instruction,
        like those on the VAX, an assembler has to examine it in detail. Fixed-length
        instructions, like those on MIPS, on the other hand, require only a cursory
        examination. The assembler performs a similar calculation to compute the space
        required for data statements. When the assembler reaches the end of an assembly
        file, the symbol table records the location of each label defined in the file.
        </p>
        <p>The assembler uses the information in the symbol table during a second pass over the
        file, which actually produces machine code. The assembler again examines each line in
        the file. If the line contains an instruction, the assembler combines the binary
        representations of its opcode and operands (register specifiers or memory address) into
        a legal instruction. Instructions and data words that reference an external symbol
        defined in another file cannot be completely assembled (they are unresolved) since the
        symbol’s address is not in the symbol table. An assembler does not complain about
        unresolved references since the corresponding label is likely to be defined in another
        file </p>
        <p>Assembly language is a programming language. Its principal difference from
        high-level languages such as BASIC, Java, and C is that assembly language provides
        only a few, simple types of data and control flow. Assembly language programs
        do not specify the type of value held in a variable. Instead, a programmer must
        apply the appropriate operations (e.g., integer or floating-point addition)
        to a value. In addition, in assembly language, programs must implement all control
        flow with <i>go to</i> s. Both factors make assembly language programming for
        any machine—MIPS or 80x86—more difficult and error-prone than writing in a high-level
        language.</p>
</div>
<div class="elaboration">
        <h4>Elaboration:</h4>
        <p>If an assembler’s speed is important, this two-step process can be done in one
        pass over the assembly file with a technique known as <dfn class="define">back
        patching</dfn>. In its pass over the file, the assembler builds a (possibly incomplete)
        binary representation of every instruction. If the instruction references a label that
        has not yet been defined, the assembler records the label and instruction in a
        table. When a label is defined, the assembler consults this table to find all
        instructions that contain a forward reference to the label. The assembler goes back and
        corrects their binary representation to incorporate the address of the
        label. Backpatching speeds assembly because the assembler only reads its input
        once. However, it requires an assembler to hold the entire binary representation of a
        program in memory so instructions can be backpatched. This requirement can limit the
        size of programs that can be assembled. The process is complicated by machines with
        several types of branches that span different ranges of instructions. When the assembler
        first sees an unresolved label in a branch instruction, it must either use the largest
        possible branch or risk having to go back and readjust many instructions to make room
        for a larger branch.

        <h3><a name="object">Object File Format</a></h3>
        <p>Assemblers produce object files. An object file on UNIX contains six distinct

        <ul type="square">
                <li>The <i>object file header</i> describes the size and position of the

                language code for routines in the source file. These routines may be unexecutable
                because of unresolved references.</li>
                <li>The <dfn class="define">data segment</dfn> contains a binary
                representation of the data in the source file. The data also may be incomplete
                because of unresolved references to labels in other files.</li>
                <li>The <dfn class="define">relocation information</dfn> identifies
                instructions and data words that depend on <dfn class="define">absolute

                <li>The <i>symbol table</i> associates addresses with external labels in

                in readable form.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The assembler produces an object file that contains a binary representation of the
        program and data and additional information to help link pieces of a program. This
        relocation information is necessary because the assembler does not know which memory
        locations a procedure or piece of data will occupy after it is linked with the rest of
        the program. Procedures and data from a file are stored in a contiguous piece of memory,
        but the assembler does not know where this memory will be located. The assembler also
        passes some symbol table entries to the linker. In particular, the assembler must record
        which external symbols are defined in a file and what unresolved references occur in a

        </p>
        <p>In Figure 1.4, the directive </p>

        .asciiz “The sum from 0 .. 100 is %d\n”

        2 describes the ASCII encoding for characters):</p>
        <pre>
        .byte 84, 104, 101, 32, 115, 117, 109, 32

        <p>The .asciiz directive is easier to read because it represents characters as letters,

        <p><i>Macros</i> are a pattern-matching and replacement facility that provide
        a simple mechanism to name a frequently used sequence of instructions. Instead
        of repeatedly typing the same instructions every time they are used, a programmer
        invokes the macro and the assembler replaces the macro call with the corresponding
        sequence of instructions. Macros, like subroutines, permit a programmer to create
        and name a new abstraction for a common operation. Unlike subroutines, however,
        macros do not cause a subroutine call and return when the program runs since
        a macro call is replaced by the macro’s body when the program is assembled.
        After this replacement, the resulting assembly is indistinguishable from the
        equivalent program written without macros.</p>
        <h4>Macros</h4>
        <p>As an example, suppose that a programmer needs to print many numbers. The
        library routine printf accepts a format string and one or more values to print
        as its arguments. A programmer could print the integer in register $7 with the
        following instructions:</p>
        <pre>
        .data
int_str: .asciiz“%d”
        .text
        la $a0, int_str         # Load string address into first arg
        mov $a1, $7             # Load value into second arg
        jal printf              # Call the printf routine
                </pre>
</div>
<div class="sidebar">
        <p><dfn class="define">formal parameter</dfn> A variable that is the

</div>
<div class="body">
        <p>The .data directive tells the assembler to store the string in the program’s
        data segment, and the .text directive tells the assembler to store the instructions
        in its text segment.</p>
        <p>However, printing many numbers in this fashion is tedious and produces a
        verbose program that is difficult to understand. An alternative is to introduce
        a macro, print_int, to print an integer:</p>
        <pre>
        int_str:.asciiz “%d”
        .text
        .macro print_int($arg)
        la $a0, int_str         # Load string address into first arg
        mov $a1, $arg           # Load macro’s parameter ($arg) into second arg
        jal printf              # Call the printf routine
        .end_macro

        print_int($7)
        </pre>
        <p>The macro has a <dfn class="define">formal parameter</dfn>, $arg,
        that names the argument to the macro. When the macro is expanded, the argument
        from a call is substituted for the formal parameter throughout the macro’s body.
        Then the assembler replaces the call with the macro’s newly expanded body. In
        the first call on print_int, the argument is $7, so the macro expands to the
        code </p>
        <pre>
        la $a0, int_str
        mov $a1, $7
        jal printf
        </pre>
        <p>In a second call on print_int, say, print_int($t0), the argument is $t0,
        so the macro expands to </p>
        <pre>
        la $a0, int_str
        mov $a1, $t0
        jal printf
        </pre>
        <p>What does the call print_int($a0) expand to? </p>
        <pre>
        la $a0, int_str
        mov $a1, $a0
        jal printf
        </pre>
        <p>This example illustrates a drawback of macros. A programmer who uses this
        macro must be aware that print_int uses register $a0 and so cannot correctly
        print the value in that register.</p>
        <b>Hardware-Software Interface:</b>
        <p>Some assemblers also implement <i>pseudoinstructions</i>, which are instructions
        provided by an assembler but not implemented in hardware. Chapter 2 contains many
        examples of how the MIPS assembler synthesizes pseudoinstructions and addressing modes
        from the spartan MIPS hardware instruction set. For example, The assembler synthesizes
        the blt instruction from two other instructions: slt and bne. By extending the
        instruction set, the MIPS assembler makes assembly language programming easier without
        complicating the hardware. Many pseudoinstructions could also be simulated with macros,
        but the MIPS assembler can generate better code for these instructions because it can
        use a dedicated register ($at) and is able to optimize the generated code.

                <h4>Elaboration</h4>
                Assemblers <i>conditionally assemble</i> pieces of code, which permits a
                programmer to include or exclude groups of instructions when a program is
                assembled. This feature is particularly useful when several versions of
                a program differ by a small amount. Rather than keep these programs in separate
                files—which greatly complicates fixing bugs in the common code—programmers
                typically merge the versions into a single file. Code particular to one
                version is conditionally assembled, so it can be excluded when other versions
                of the program are assembled.
                <p>If macros and conditional assembly are useful, why do assemblers for
                UNIX systems rarely, if ever, provide them? One reason is that most programmers
                on these systems write programs in higher-level languages like C. Most of
                the assembly code is produced by compilers, which find it more convenient

        <p><dfn class="define">separate compilation</dfn> Splitting a program
        across many files, each of which can be compiled without knowledge of what is
        in the other files.</p>

        <h2><a name="linkers">Linkers</a></h2>
        <p><dfn class="define">Separate compilation</dfn> permits a program
        to be split into pieces that are stored in different files. Each file contains
        a logically related collection of subroutines and data structures that form
        a <i>module</i> in a larger program. A file can be compiled and assembled independently
        of other files, so changes to one module do not require recompiling the entire
        program. As we discussed above, separate compilation necessitates the additional
        step of linking to combine object files from separate modules and fix their
        unresolved references.</p>
        <p>The tool that merges these files is the <i>linker</i> (see Figure 3.1).
        It performs three tasks:</p>
        <ul type="square">
                <li>Searches the program libraries to find library routines used by the
                program </li>
                <li>Determines the memory locations that code from each module will occupy
                and relocates its instructions by adjusting absolute references </li>
                <li>Resolves references among files </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A linker’s first task is to ensure that a program contains no undefined labels.
        The linker matches the external symbols and unresolved references from a pro-gram’s
        files. An external symbol in one file resolves a reference from another file
        if both refer to a label with the same name. Unmatched references mean a symbol
        was used, but not defined anywhere in the program.</p>
        <p>Unresolved references at this stage in the linking process do not necessarily
        mean a programmer made a mistake. The program could have referenced a library
        routine whose code was not in the object files passed to the linker. After matching
        symbols in the program, the linker searches the system’s program libraries to
        find predefined subroutines and data structures that the program references.
        The basic libraries contain routines that read and write data, allocate and
        deallocate memory, and perform numeric operations. Other libraries contain routines
        to access a database or manipulate terminal windows. A program that references
        an unresolved symbol that is not in any library is erroneous and cannot be linked.
        When the program uses a library routine, the linker extracts the routine’s code
        from the library and incorporates it into the program text segment. This new
        routine, in turn, may depend on other library routines, so the linker continues
        to fetch other library routines until no external references are unresolved
        or a routine cannot be found.</p>
        <p>If all external references are resolved, the linker next determines the memory
        locations that each module will occupy. Since the files were assembled in isolation, the
        assembler could not know where a module’s instructions or data will be placed
        relative to other modules. When the linker places a module in memory, all absolute
        references must be <i>relocated</i> to reflect its true location.  Since the linker has
        relocation information that identifies all relocatable references, it can efficiently
        find and backpatch these references.</p>

        collection of object files and program libraries to find nonlocal routines used in a
        program, combines them into a single executable file, and resolves references between
        routines in different files.</b></p>
        <p>The linker produces an executable file that can run on a computer. Typically,
        this file has the same format as an object file, except that it contains no
        unresolved references or relocation information.</p>

<div class="body">
        <p>A program that links without an error can be run. Before being run, the program
        resides in a file on secondary storage, such as a disk. On UNIX systems, the operating

        the operating system performs the following steps:</p>
        <ol type="1">
                <li>Reads the executable file’s header to determine the size of the text

        <h2><a name="memory">Memory Usage</a></h2>
        <p>The next few sections elaborate the description of the MIPS architecture
        presented earlier in the book. Earlier chapters focused primarily on hardware
        and its relationship with low-level software. These sections focus primarily
        on how assembly language programmers use MIPS hardware. These sections describe
        a set of conventions followed on many MIPS systems. For the most part, the hardware
        does not impose these conventions. Instead, they represent an agreement among
        programmers to follow the same set of rules so that software written by different
        people can work together and make effective use of MIPS hardware.</p>
        <p>Systems based on MIPS processors typically divide memory into three parts
        (see Figure 5.1). The first part, near the bottom of the address space (starting
        at address 400000hex), is the <i>text segment</i>, which holds the program’s
        instructions.</p>
        <p>The second part, above the text segment, is the <i>data segment</i>, which
        is further divided into two parts.
        <dfn class="define">Static data</dfn> (starting at address 10000000hex) contains objects
        whose size is known to the compiler and whose lifetime—the interval during which a
        program can access them—is the program’s entire execution. For example, in C,
        global variables are statically allocated since they can be referenced anytime during a
        program’s execution. The linker both assigns static objects to locations in the data
        segment and resolves references to these objects.</p>
        <img class="hpfig" src="Fig5_1.jpg" height="300" ><p><b>Figure 5.1 Layout of memory.</b></p>
        <h4>Hardware-Software Interface</h4>
        Because the data segment begins far above the program at address 10000000
        <sub>hex</sub>, load and store instructions cannot directly reference data objects with
        their16-bit offset fields. For example, to load the word in the data segment at address
        10010020 <sub>hex</sub>into register $v0 requires two instructions:
        <pre>
        lui $s0, 0x1001 # 0x1001 means 1001 base 16
        lw $v0, 0x0020($s0) # 0x10010000 + 0x0020 = 0x10010020
        </pre>
        <p>(The <i>0x</i> before a number means that it is a hexadecimal value. For example,
        0x8000 is 8000hex or 32,768 <sub>ten </sub>.) </p>
        <p>To avoid repeating the lui instruction at every load and store, MIPS systems
        typically dedicate a register ($gp) as a <i>global pointer</i> to the static
        data segment. This register contains address 10008000 <sub>hex, </sub>so load
        and store instructions can use their signed 16-bit offset fields to access the
        first 64 KB of the static data segment. With this global pointer, we can rewrite
        the example as a single instruction:</p>
        <pre>
        lw $v0, 0x8020($gp)
        </pre>
        <p>Of course, a global pointer register makes addressing locations 10000000
        <sub>hex</sub>– 10010000 <sub>hex</sub>faster than other heap locations. The
        MIPS compiler usually stores <i>global variables</i> in this area because these
        variables have fixed locations and fit better than other global data, such as
        arrays.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
        <p><dfn class="define">stack segment</dfn> The portion of memory used
        by a program to hold procedure call frames.</p>
        <p><dfn class="define">register-use convention</dfn> Also called
        <dfn class="define">procedure call convention</dfn> A software protocol
        governing the use of registers by procedures.</p>
</div>
<div class="body">
        <p>Immediately above static data is <i>dynamic data</i>. This data, as its name implies,
        is allocated by the program as it executes. In C programs, the malloc library routine
        finds and returns a new block of memory. Since a compiler cannot predict how much memory
        a program will allocate, the operating system expands the dynamic data area to meet
        demand. As the upward arrow in the figure indicates, malloc expands the dynamic area
        with the sbrk system call, which causes the operating system to add more pages to the
        program’s virtual address space immediately above the dynamic data segment.</p>
        <p>The third part, the program <dfn class="define">stack segment</dfn>,
        resides at the top of the virtual address space (starting at address 7fffffff
        <sub>hex</sub>). Like dynamic data, the maximum size of a pro-gram’s stack
        is not known in advance. As the program pushes values on the stack, the operating
        system expands the stack segment down, toward the data segment.</p>
        <p>This three-part division of memory is not the only possible one. However,
        it has two important characteristics: the two dynamically expandable segments
        are as far apart as possible, and they can grow to use a program’s entire address
        space.</p>
        <h2><a name="procedure">Procedure Call Conventions</a></h2>
        <p>Conventions governing the use of registers are necessary when procedures
        in a program are compiled separately. To compile a particular procedure, a compiler
        must know which registers it may use and which registers are reserved for other
        procedures. Rules for using registers are called <dfn class="define">register
        use</dfn> or <dfn class="define">procedure call conventions</dfn>.
        As the name implies, these rules are, for the most part, conventions
        followed by software rather than rules enforced by hardware. However, most compilers
        and programmers try very hard to follow these conventions because violating
        them causes insidious bugs.</p>
        <p>The calling convention described in this section is the one used by the gcc
        compiler. The native MIPS compiler uses a more complex convention that is slightly
        faster.</p>
        <p>The MIPS CPU contains 32 general-purpose registers that are numbered 0–31.
        Register $0 always contains the hardwired value 0.</p>
        <ul type="square">
                <li>Registers $at (1), $k0 (26), and $k1 (27) are reserved for the assembler

                </li>
                <li>Registers $a0–$a3 (4–7) are used to pass the first four arguments to
                routines (remaining arguments are passed on the stack). Registers $v0 and

                preserved across calls.</li>

                registers</dfn> that hold long-lived values that should be preserved
                across calls.</li>
                <li>Register $gp (28) is a global pointer that points to the middle of a

                <li>Register $sp (29) is the stack pointer, which points to the last location
                on the stack. Register $fp (30) is the frame pointer. The jal instruction
                writes register $ra (31), the return address from a procedure call. These
                two registers are explained in the next section.</li>

        uses.</p>
        <h3><a name="procedure">Procedure Calls</a></h3>
        <p>This section describes the steps that occur when one procedure (the <i>caller
        </i> ) invokes another procedure (the <i>callee</i> ). Programmers who write in
        a high-level language (like C or Pascal) never see the details of how one procedure
        calls another because the compiler takes care of this low-level bookkeeping.
        However, assembly language programmers must explicitly implement every procedure
        call and return.</p>
        <p>Most of the bookkeeping associated with a call is centered around a block
        of memory called a <dfn class="define">procedure call frame</dfn>.
        This memory is used for a variety of purposes:</p>
        <ul type="square">
                <li>To hold values passed to a procedure as arguments </li>
                <li>To save registers that a procedure may modify, but which the procedure’s
                caller does not want changed </li>
                <li>To provide space for variables local to a procedure </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In most programming languages, procedure calls and returns follow a strict
        last-in, first-out (LIFO) order, so this memory can be allocated and deallocated
        on a stack, which is why these blocks of memory are sometimes called stack frames.
        </p>
        <p>Figure 6.2 shows a typical stack frame. The frame consists of the memory
        between the frame pointer ($fp), which points to the first word of the frame,
        and the stack pointer ($sp), which points to the last word of the frame. The
        stack grows down from higher memory addresses, so the frame pointer points above
        the stack pointer. The executing procedure uses the frame pointer to quickly
        access values in its stack frame. For example, an argument in the stack frame
        can be loaded into register $v0 with the instruction </p>

        <img class="hpfig" src="Fig6_2.jpg" height="350" ><p><b>Figure 6.2 Layout of a stack
        frame.</b> The frame pointer ($fp) points to the first word in the currently
        executing procedure’s stack frame. The stack pointer ($sp) points to the last
        word of frame. The first four arguments are passed in registers, so the fifth
        argument is the first one stored on the stack.</p>
        <p>A stack frame may be built in many different ways; however, the caller and
        callee must agree on the sequence of steps. The steps below describe the calling
        convention used on most MIPS machines. This convention comes into play at three
        points during a procedure call: immediately before the caller invokes the callee,
        just as the callee starts executing, and immediately before the callee returns
        to the caller. In the first part, the caller puts the procedure call arguments
        in standard places and invokes the callee to do the following:</p>
        <ol type="1">
                <li>Pass arguments. By convention, the first four arguments are passed in
                registers $a0–$a3. Any remaining arguments are pushed on the stack and appear
                at the beginning of the called procedure’s stack frame.</li>
                <li>Save caller-saved registers. The called procedure can use these registers
                ($a0–$a3 and $t0–$t9) without first saving their value. If the caller expects
                to use one of these registers after a call, it must save its value before
                the call.</li>
                <li>Execute a jal instruction, which jumps to the callee’s first instruction
                and saves the return address in register $ra.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Before a called routine starts running, it must take the following steps
        to set up its stack frame:</p>
        <ol type="1">
                <li>Allocate memory for the frame by subtracting the frame’s size from the
                stack pointer.</li>
                <li>Save callee-saved registers in the frame. A callee must save the values
                in these registers ($s0–$s7, $fp, and $ra) before altering them since the
                caller expects to find these registers unchanged after the call. Register
                $fp is saved by every procedure that allocates a new stack frame. However,
                register $ra only needs to be saved if the callee itself makes a call. The
                other calleesaved registers that are used also must be saved.</li>
                <li>Establish the frame pointer by adding the stack frame’s size minus 4
                to $sp and storing the sum in register $fp.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Hardware-Software Interface</h4>
        <p>The MIPS register use convention provides callee- and caller-saved registers because
        both types of registers are advantageous in different circumstances. Callee-saved
        registers are better used to hold long-lived values, such as variables from a user’s
        program. These registers are only saved during a procedure call if the callee expects to
        use the register. On the other hand, caller-saved registers are better used to hold
        short-lived quantities that do not persist across a call, such as immediate values in an
        address calculation. During a call, the callee can also use these registers for
        short-lived temporaries.</p>
        <p>Finally, the callee returns to the caller by executing the following steps:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
                <li>If the callee is a function that returns a value, place the returned value
                in register $v0.</li>
                <li>Restore all callee-saved registers that were saved upon procedure entry.
                </li>
                <li>Pop the stack frame by adding the frame size to $sp.</li>
                <li>Return by jumping to the address in register $ra.</li>

                of Fortran prohibited recursion because statically allocated frames produced
                faster code on some older machines. However, on load-store architectures like

        <h3><a name="procedure">Procedure Call Example</a></h3>
        <pre>
        main () {
          printf (&quot;The factorial of 10 is %d\n&quot;, fact (10));
        }

        int fact (int n) {
          if (n &lt; 1)
            return (1);
          else
            return (n * fact (n - 1));
        }
        </pre>
        <p>which computes and prints 10! (the factorial of 10, 10! = 10 × 9 × . . .
        × 1). fact is a recursive routine that computes <i>n</i> ! by multiplying <i>
        n</i> times ( <i>n</i> – 1)!. The assembly code for this routine illustrates how
        programs manipulate stack frames.</p>
        <p>Upon entry, the routine main creates its stack frame and saves the two calleesaved
        registers it will modify: $fp and $ra. The frame is larger than required for
        these two registers because the calling convention requires the minimum size
        of a stack frame to be 24 bytes. This minimum frame can hold four argument registers
        ($a0–$a3) and the return address $ra, padded to a double-word boundary (24 bytes).
        Since main also needs to save $fp, its stack frame must be two words larger
        (remember: the stack pointer is kept doubleword aligned).</p>
        <pre>
        .text
        .globl main
main:
        subu $sp,$sp,32         # Stack frame is 32 bytes long
        sw $ra,20($sp)          # Save return address
        sw $fp,16($sp)          # Save old frame pointer
        addiu $fp,$sp,28        # Set up frame pointer
        </pre>
        <p>The routine main then calls the factorial routine and passes it the single
        argument 10. After fact returns, main calls the library routine printf and passes
        it both a format string and the result returned from fact:</p>
        <pre>
        li $a0,10               # Put argument (10) in $a0
        jal fact                # Call factorial function
        la $a0,$LC              # Put format string in $a0
        move $a1,$v0            # Move fact result to $a1
        jal printf              # Call the print function
        </pre>
        <p>Finally, after printing the factorial, main returns. But first, it must restore
        the registers it saved and pop its stack frame:</p>
        <pre>
        lw $ra,20($sp)          # Restore return address
        lw $fp,16($sp)          # Restore frame pointer
        addiu $sp,$sp,32        # Pop stack frame
        jr $ra                  # Return to caller
        .rdata
$LC:
        .ascii “The factorial of 10 is %d\n\000”
        </pre>
        <p>The factorial routine is similar in structure to main. First, it creates
        a stack frame and saves the callee-saved registers it will use. In addition
        to saving $ra and $fp, fact also saves its argument ($a0), which it will use
        for the recursive call:</p>
        <pre>
        lw $ra,20($sp)          # Restore return address
        lw $fp,16($sp)          # Restore frame pointer
        addiu $sp,$sp,32        # Pop stack frame
        jr $ra                  # Return to caller
        .rdata
$LC:
        .ascii “The factorial of 10 is %d\n\000”
        </pre>
        <p>The heart of the fact routine performs the computation from the C program.
        It tests if the argument is greater than 0. If not, the routine returns the
        value 1. If the argument is greater than 0, the routine recursively calls itself
        to compute fact(n-1) and multiplies that value times <i>n:</i> </p>
        <pre>
        lw $v0,0($fp)           # Load n
        bgtz $v0,$L2            # Branch if n &gt; 0
        li $v0,1                # Return 1
        jr $L1                  # Jump to code to return
$L2:
        lw $v1,0($fp)           # Load n
        subu $v0,$v1,1          # Compute n - 1
        move $a0,$v0            # Move value to $a0
        jal fact                # Call factorial function
        lw $v1,0($fp)           # Load n
        mul $v0,$v0,$v1         # Compute fact(n-1) * n
        </pre>
        <p>Finally, the factorial routine restores the callee-saved registers and returns
        the value in register $v0:</p>
        <pre>
        $L1:                    # Result is in $v0
        lw $ra, 20($sp)         # Restore $ra
        lw $fp, 16($sp)         # Restore $fp
        addiu $sp, $sp, 32      # Pop stack
        jr $ra                  # Return to caller
        </pre>
        <h4>Stack in Recursive Procedure</h4>
        <p>Figure 6.3 shows the stack at the call fact(7). main runs first, so its
        frame is deepest on the stack. main calls fact(10), whose stack frame is next
        on the stack. Each invocation recursively invokes fact to compute the next-lowest
        factorial. The stack frames parallel the LIFO order of these calls.</p>

        <h4>Elaboration:</h4>
	<p>The difference between the MIPS compiler and the gcc compiler is that the MIPS
        compiler usually does not use a frame pointer, so this register is available as another
        callee-saved register, $s8. This change saves a couple of instructions in the procedure
        call and return sequence. However, it complicates code generation because a procedure
        must access its stack frame with $sp, whose value can change during a procedure’s
        execution if values are pushed on the stack.</p>

        <p>The assembly code for this program is below. The tak function first saves its return
        address in its stack frame and its arguments in callee-saved registers, since the
        routine may make calls that need to use registers $a0–$a2 and $ra.  The function uses
        callee-saved registers since they hold values that persist over the lifetime of the
        function, which includes several calls that could potentially modify registers.</p>

        <p>The routine then begins execution by testing if y &lt; x. If not, it branches

        bge $s1, $s0, L1 # if (y &lt; x)
        </pre>
        <p>If y &lt; x, then it executes the body of the routine, which contains four recursive
        calls. The first call uses almost the same arguments as its parent:</p>

        move $s3, $v0
        </pre>
        <p>Note that the result from the first recursive call is saved in register $s3,
        so that it can be used later. The function now prepares arguments for the second
        recursive call.</p>
        <pre>
        addiu $a0, $s1, -1

        </pre>
        <p>In the instructions below, the result from this recursive call is saved in
        register $s0. But, first we need to read, for the last time, the saved value
        of the first argument from this register.</p>
        <pre>
        addiu $a0, $s2, -1

        jal tak                 # tak (z - 1, x, y)
        </pre>
        <p>After the three inner recursive calls, we are ready for the final recursive
        call. After the call, the function’s result is in $v0 and control jumps to the
        function’s epilogue.</p>
        <pre>
        move $a0, $s3
        move $a1, $s0

        addiu $v0, $v0, 1
        j L2
        </pre>
        <p>This code at label L1 is the consequent of the <i>if-then-else</i> statement.
        It just moves the value of argument z into the return register and falls into
        the function epilogue.</p>
        <pre>
L1:
        move $v0, $s2
        </pre>
        <p>The code below is the function epilogue, which restores the saved registers
        and returns the function’s result to its caller.</p>

        <p>The main routine calls the tak function with its initial arguments, then

        <p>1. This section discusses exceptions in the MIPS32 architecture, which is
        what SPIM implementsin Version 7.0 and later. Earlier versions of SPIM implemented
        the MIPS-I architecture, which handled exceptions slightly differently. Converting
        programs from these versions to run on MIPS32 should not be difficult, as the
        changes are limited to the Status and Cause register fields and the replacement
        of the rfe instruction by the eret instruction.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebar">
        <p><dfn class="define">interrupt handler</dfn> A piece of code that
        is run as a result of an exception or an interrupt.</p>
</div>
<div class="body">
        <p>These seven registers are part of coprocessor 0’s register set. They are
        accessed by the mfc0 and mtc0 instructions. After an exception, register EPC
        contains the address of the instruction that was executing when the exception
        occurred. If the exception was caused by an external interrupt, then the instruction
        will not have started executing. All other exceptions are caused by the execution
        of the instruction at EPC, except when the offending instruction is in the delay
        slot of a branch or jump. In that case, EPC points to the branch or jump instruction
        and the BD bit is set in the Cause register. When that bit is set, the exception
        handler must look at EPC + 4 for the offending instruction. However, in either
        case, an exception handler properly resumes the program by returning to the
        instruction at EPC.</p>
        <p>If the instruction that caused the exception made a memory access, register
        BadVAddr contains the referenced memory location’s address.</p>
        <p>The Count register is a timer that increments at a fixed rate (by default,
        every 10 milliseconds) while SPIM is running. When the value in the Count register
        equals the value in the Compare register, a hardware interrupt at priority level
        5 occurs.</p>
        <p>Figure 7.1 shows the subset of the Status register fields implemented by
        the MIPS simulator SPIM. The interrupt mask field contains a bit for each of
        the six hardware and two software interrupt levels. A mask bit that is 1 allows
        interrupts at that level to interrupt the processor. A mask bit that is 0 disables
        interrupts at that level. When an interrupt arrives, it sets its interrupt pending
        bit in the Cause register, even if the mask bit is disabled. When an interrupt
        is pending, it will interrupt the processor when its mask bit is subsequently
        enabled.</p>
        <p>The user mode bit is 0 if the processor is running in kernel mode and 1 if it is
        running in user mode. On SPIM, this bit is fixed at 1, since the SPIM processor does not
        implement kernel mode. The exception level bit is normally 0, but is set to 1 after an
        exception occurs. When this bit is 1, interrupts are disabled and the EPC is not updated
        if another exception occurs. This bit prevents an exception handler from being disturbed
        by an interrupt or exception, but it should be reset when the handler finishes. If the
        interrupt enable bit is 1, interrupts are allowed. If it is 0, they are disabled.</p>

        </b></p>
        <p>Figure 7.2 shows the subset of Cause register fields that SPIM implements.
        The branch delay bit is 1 if the last exception occurred in an instruction executed
        in the delay slot of a branch. The interrupt pending bits become 1 when an interrupt
        is raised at a given hardware or software level. The exception code register
        describes the cause of an exception through the following codes:</p>

        <p>Exceptions and interrupts cause a MIPS processor to jump to a piece of code,
        at address 80000180 <sub>hex</sub>(in the kernel, not user address space),
        called an <i>exception handler</i>. This code examines the exception’s cause
        and jumps to an appropriate point in the operating system. The operating system
        responds to an exception either by terminating the process that caused the exception
        or by performing some action. A process that causes an error, such as executing
        an unimplemented instruction, is killed by the operating system. On the other
        hand, other exceptions such as page faults are requests from a process to the
        operating system to perform a service, such as bringing in a page from disk.
        The operating system processes these requests and resumes the process. The final
        type of exceptions are interrupts from external devices. These generally cause
        the operating system to move data to or from an I/O device and resume the interrupted
        process.</p>
        <p>The code in the example below is a simple exception handler, which invokes
        a routine to print a message at each exception (but not interrupts). This code
        is similar to the exception handler (exceptions.s) used by the SPIM simulator.
        </p>
        <h3><a name="exception">Exception Handler</a></h3>
        <p>The exception handler first saves register $at, which is used in pseudo-instructions
        in the handler code, then saves $a0 and $a1, which it later uses to pass arguments.
        The exception handler cannot store the old values from these registers on the
        stack, as would an ordinary routine, because the cause of the exception might
        have been a memory reference that used a bad value (such as 0) in the stack
        pointer. Instead, the exception handler stores these registers in an exception
        handler register ($k1, since it can’t access memory without using $at) and two
        memory locations (save0 and save1). If the exception routine itself could be
        interrupted, two locations would not be enough since the second exception would
        overwrite values saved during the first exception. However, this simple exception
        handler finishes running before it enables interrupts, so the problem does not
        arise.</p>
        <pre>
        .ktext 0x80000180
        mov $k1, $at            # Save $at register
        sw $a0, save0           # Handler is not re-entrant and can’t use
        sw $a1, save1           # stack to save $a0, $a1
        # Don’t need to save $k0/$k1
        </pre>
        <p>The exception handler then moves the Cause and EPC registers into CPU registers.
        The Cause and EPC registers are not part of the CPU register set. Instead, they
        are registers in coprocessor 0, which is the part of the CPU that handles exceptions.
        The instruction mfc0 $k0, $13 moves coprocessor 0’s register 13 (the Cause register)
        into CPU register $k0. Note that the exception handler need not save registers
        $k0 and $k1 because user programs are not supposed to use these registers. The
        exception handler uses the value from the Cause register to test if the exception
        was caused by an interrupt (see the preceding table). If so, the exception is
        ignored. If the exception was not an interrupt, the handler calls print_excp
        to print a message.</p>
        <pre>
        mfc0 $k0, $13           # Move Cause into $k0

        <h4>Elaboration:</h4>
	<p>On real MIPS processors, the return from an exception handler is more complex. The
        exception handler cannot always jump to the instruction following EPC. For example, if
        the instruction that caused the exception was in a branch instruction’s delay slot
        (see Chapter 6), the next instruction to execute may not be the following instruction in
        memory.</p>

        <h2><a name="input">Input and Output</a></h2>
        <p>SPIM simulates one I/O device: a memory-mapped console on which a program can read
        and write characters. When a program is running, SPIM connects its own terminal (or a
        separate console window in xspim, PCSpim, or QtSpim) to the processor.  A MIPS program
        running on SPIM can read the characters that you type. In addition, if the MIPS program
        writes characters to the terminal, they appear on the terminal or in console window.</p>
        <p>One exception to this rule is control-C in the basic spim simulator. This character
        is not passed to the program, but instead causes spim to stop and return to command
        mode. This functionality is not necessary in the other version of spim, whose window
        interfaces provide other ways to stop a program.</p>
        <p>To use memory-mapped I/O (see below), spim or xspim must be started with the
        -mapped_io flag. PCSpim and QtSpim can enable memory-mapped I/O through a command line
        flag or the &quot;Settings&quot; dialog.</p>
        <p>The console consists of two independent units: a <i>receiver</i> and
        a <i>transmitter</i>. The receiver reads characters typed on the keyboard. The
        transmitter display characters on the console. The two units are completely
        independent. This means, for example, that characters typed at the keyboard are not
        automatically echoed on the display. Instead, a program echoes a character by reading it
        from the receiver and writing it to the transmitter. It also means that editing
        commands, such as backspace, are just characters and the run program must interpret them
        and implement its own editing functionality.</p>
        <p>A program controls the console with four memory-mapped device registers, as shown in
        Figure 8.1. “Memory-mapped” means that each register appears as a special memory
        location. The <i>Receiver Control Register</i> is at location
        ffff0000<sub>hex</sub>. Only two of its bits are actually used. Bit 0 is called
        “ready”: if it is 1, it means that a character has arrived from the keyboard but
        has not yet been read from the Receiver Data Register. The ready bit is read-only:
        writes to it are ignored. The ready bit changes from 0 to 1 when a character is typed at
        the keyboard, and it changes from 1 to 0 when the character is read from the Receiver
        Data Register.</p>
        <img class="hpfig" src="Fig8_1.jpg" height="500" ><p><b>Figure 8.1 The console is controlled
        by four device registers, each of which appears as a memory location at the
        given address.</b></p>
        <p>Bit 1 of the Receiver Control Register is the keyboard “interrupt enable.” This
        bit may be both read and written by a program. The interrupt enable is initially 0. If
        it is set to 1 by a program, the console causes an interrupt at hardware level 1
        whenever a character is typed and the ready bit becomes 1. However, for the interrupt to
        affect the processor, interrupts must also be enabled in the Status register. All other
        bits of the Receiver Control Register are unused.</p>
        <p>The second console device register is the <i>Receiver Data Register</i> (at address
        ffff0004<sub>hex</sub>). The low-order 8 bits of this register contain the last
        character typed at the keyboard. All other bits contain 0s. This register is read-only
        and changes only when a new character is typed at the keyboard.  Reading the Receiver
        Data register resets the ready bit in the Receiver Control Register to 0. The value in
        this register is undefined if the Receiver Control Register is 0.</p>
        <p>The third console device register is the <i>Transmitter Control Register
        </i> (at address ffff0008<sub>hex</sub>). Only the low-order 2 bits of this register are
        used. They behave much like the corresponding bits of the Receiver Control register. Bit
        0 is called “ready” and is read-only. If this bit is 1, the transmitter is ready
        to accept a new character for output. If it is 0, the transmitter is still busy writing
        the previous character. Bit 1 is “interrupt enable” and is readable and
        writable. If this bit is set to 1, then the console requests an interrupt at hardware
        level 0 whenever the transmitter is ready for a new character and the ready bit becomes
        1.</p>
        <p>The final device register is the <i>Transmitter Data Register</i> (at address
        ffff000c <sub>hex</sub>). When a value is written into this location, its low-order 8
        bits (i.e., an ASCII character) are sent to the console. When the Transmitter Data
        register is written, the ready bit in the Transmitter Control register is reset to
        0. This bit stays 0 until enough time has elapsed to transmit the character to the
        console; then the ready bit becomes 1 again. The Transmitter Data Register should only
        be written when the ready bit of the Transmitter Control register is 1. If the
        transmitter is not ready, writes to the Transmitter Data Register are ignored (the write
        appears to succeed but the character is not output).</p>
        <p>Real computers require time to send characters to a console or terminal.
        These time lags are simulated by SPIM. For example, after the transmitter starts
        to write a character, the transmitter’s ready bit becomes 0 for a while. SPIM
        measures time in instructions executed, not in real clock time. This means that
        the transmitter does not become ready again until the processor executes a fixed
        number of instructions. If you stop the machine and look at the ready bit, it
        will not change. However, if you let the machine run, the bit eventually changes
        back to 1.</p>
        <h2><a name="spim">SPIM</a></h2>
        <p>SPIM is a software simulator that runs assembly language programs written
        for processors that implement the MIPS32 architecture, specifically Release
        1 of this architecture with a fixed memory mapping, no caches, and only coprocessors
        0 and 1.<sup>2 </sup>SPIM’s name is just MIPS spelled backwards. SPIM can read
        and immediately execute assembly language files. SPIM is a self-contained system
        for running MIPS programs. It contains a debugger and provides a few operating
        system–like services. SPIM is much slower than a real computer (100 or more times).
        However, its low cost and wide availability cannot be matched by
        real hardware!
        </p>
        <p>Earlier versions of SPIM (before 7.0) implemented the MIPS-I architecture
        used in the original MIPS R2000 processors. This architecture is almost a proper
        subset of the MIPS32 architecture, with the difference being the manner in which
        exceptions are handled. MIPS32 also introduced approximately 60 new instructions,
        which are supported by SPIM. Programs that ran on the earlier versions of SPIM
        and did not use exceptions should run unmodified on newer versions of SPIM.
        Programs that used exceptions will require minor changes.</p>
        <p>An obvious question is, Why use a simulator when most people have PCs that
        contain processors that run significantly faster than SPIM? One reason is that
        the processor in PCs are Intel 80x86s, whose architecture is far less regular
        and far more complex to understand and program than MIPS processors. The MIPS
        architecture may be the epitome of a simple, clean RISC machine.</p>
        <p>In addition, simulators can provide a better environment for assembly programming
        than an actual machine because they can detect more errors and provide a better
        interface than an actual computer.</p>
        <p>Finally, simulators are a useful tool in studying computers and the programs
        that run on them. Because they are implemented in software, not silicon, simulators
        can be examined and easily modified to add new instructions, build new systems
        such as multiprocessors, or simply to collect data.</p>
        <h3><a name="simulation">Simulation of a Virtual Machine</a></h3>
        <p>The basic MIPS architecture is difficult to program directly because of delayed
        branches, delayed loads, and restricted address modes. This difficulty is tolerable
        since these computers were designed to be programmed in high-level languages
        and present an interface designed for compilers rather than assembly language
        programmers. A good part of the programming complexity results from delayed
        instructions. A <i>delayed branch</i> requires two cycles to execute. In the
        second cycle, the instruction immediately following the branch executes. This
        instruction can perform useful work that normally would have been done before
        the branch. It can also be a nop (no operation) that does nothing. Similarly,
        <i>delayed loads</i> require 2 cycles to bring a value from memory, so the instruction
        immediately following a load cannot use the value.</p>
        <p>MIPS wisely chose to hide this complexity by having its assembler implement
        a <dfn class="define">virtual machine</dfn> . This virtual computer
        appears to have nondelayed branches and loads and a richer instruction set than
        the actual hardware. The assembler <i>reorga</i> <i></i> <i>nizes</i> (rearranges)
        instructions to fill the delay slots. The virtual computer also provides <i>
        pseudoinstructions</i>, which appear as real instructions in assembly language
        programs. The hardware, however, knows nothing about pseudoinstructions, so
        the assembler translates them into equivalent sequences of actual machine instructions.
        For example, the MIPS hardware only provides instructions to branch when a register
        is equal to or not equal to 0. Other conditional branches, such as one that
        branches when one register is greater than another, are synthesized by comparing
        the two registers and branching when the result of the comparison is true (nonzero).

</div>
<div class="body">
        <p>By default, SPIM simulates the richer virtual machine, since this is the
        machine that most programmers will find useful. However, SPIM can also simulate
        the delayed branches and loads in the actual hardware. Below, we describe the
        virtual machine and only mention in passing features that do not belong to the
        actual hardware. In doing so, we follow the convention of MIPS assembly language
        programmers (and compilers), who routinely use the extended machine as if it
        was implemented in silicon.</p>
        <h3><a name="getting">Getting Started with SPIM</a></h3>
        <p>The rest of this appendix introduces SPIM and the MIPS R2000 Assembly language.
        Many details should never concern you; however, the sheer volume of information
        can sometimes obscure the fact that SPIM is a simple, easy-to-use program. This
        section starts with a quick tutorial on using SPIM, which should enable you
        to load, debug, and run simple MIPS programs.</p>
        <p>SPIM comes in different versions for different types of computer systems.
        The one constant is the simplest version, called spim, which is a command-line-driven
        program that runs in a terminal window. It operates like most programs of this
        type: you type a line of text, hit the return key, and spim executes your command.
        Despite its lack of a fancy interface, spim can do everything that its fancy
        cousins can do.</p>
        <p>QtSpim is a version of the simulator with a window interface. It runs on Microsoft
        Windows, Apple OS X, and Linux.<p>
        <p>There are two older cousins to spim. The version that runs in the X-windows
        environment of a UNIX or Linux system is called xspim. PCspim is a windowing
        version of spim that runs on Microsoft Windows.</p>
        <h3><a name="surprising">Surprising Features</a></h3>
        <p>Although SPIM faithfully simulates the MIPS computer, SPIM is a simulator
        and certain things are not identical to an actual computer. The most obvious
        differences are that instruction timing and the memory system are not identical.
        SPIM does not simulate caches or memory latency, nor does it accurately reflect
        float-ing-point operation or multiply and divide instruction delays. In addition,
        the floating-point instructions do not detect many error conditions, which would
        cause exceptions on a real machine.</p>
        <p>Another surprise (which occurs on the real machine as well) is that a pseudoinstruction
        expands to several machine instructions. When you single-step or examine memory,
        the instructions that you see are different from the source program. The correspondence
        between the two sets of instructions is fairly simple since SPIM does not reorganize
        instructions to fill delay slots.</p>
        <h3><a name="byte">Byte Order</a></h3>
        <p>Processors can number bytes within a word so the byte with the lowest number
        is either the leftmost or rightmost one. The convention used by a machine is
        called its <i>byte order</i>. MIPS processors can operate with either <i>big-endian
        </i> or <i>little-endian</i> byte order. For example, in a big-endian machine,
        the directive .byte 0, 1, 2, 3 would result in a memory word containing </p>
        <table class="picture" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
                <tr>
                        <th align="center" colspan="4" width="50">Byte #</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                        <td align="center" width="25">0 </td>
                        <td align="center" width="25">1 </td>
                        <td align="center" width="25">2 </td>
                        <td align="center" width="25">3 </td>
                </tr>
        </table>
        <p>while in a little-endian machine, the word would contain </p>
        <table class="picture" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
                <tr>
                        <th align="center" colspan="4" width="50">Byte #</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                        <td align="center" width="25">3 </td>
                        <td align="center" width="25">2 </td>
                        <td align="center" width="25">1 </td>
                        <td align="center" width="25">0 </td>
                </tr>
        </table>
        <p>SPIM operates with both byte orders. SPIM’s byte order is the same as the
        byte order of the underlying machine that runs the simulator. For example, on
        a Intel 80x86, SPIM is little-endian, while on a Macintosh or Sun SPARC, SPIM
        is bigendian.</p>
        <h3><a name="system">System Calls</a></h3>
        <p>SPIM provides a small set of operating-system-like services through the system
        call (syscall) instruction. To request a service, a program loads the system
        call code (see Figure 9.1) into register $v0 and arguments into registers
        $a0–$a3 (or $f12 for floating-point values). System calls that return values
        put their results in register $v0 (or $f0 for floating-point results). For example,
        the following code prints “the answer = 5”:</p>
        <pre>
        .data
str:
        .asciiz &quot;the answer = &quot;
        .text
        li $v0, 4               # system call code for print_str
        la $a0, str             # address of string to print
        syscall                 # print the string
        li $v0, 1               # system call code for print_int
        li $a0, 5               # integer to print
        syscall                 # print it
        </pre>

        print_float prints a single floating-point number; print_double prints a double
        precision number; and print_string is passed a pointer to a null-terminated
        string, which it writes to the console.</p>
        <p>The system calls read_int, read_float, and read_double read an entire line

        It reads up to <i>n</i> – 1 characters into a buffer and terminates the string
        with a null byte. If fewer than <i>n</i> – 1 characters are on the current line,
        read_string reads up to and including the newline and again null-terminates
        the string.</p>
        <p>The console operates in &quote;raw mode&quot; and passes all keyboad input to the program.
        This means that it does not provide editing operations, such as backspace, which are the

        for read_int and the like.</p>

        such as floating-point numbers (see Figure 10.1). SPIM simulates two coprocessors.
        Coprocessor 0 handles exceptions and interrupts. Coprocessor 1 is the float-ing-point

<div class="elaboration">
        <h4>Elaboration:</h4>
	<p>The MIPS assembler (and SPIM) synthesizes the more complex addressing modes by
        producing one or more instructions before the load or store to compute a complex
        address. For example, suppose that the label table referred to memory location
        0x10000004 and a program contained the instruction </p>
        <pre>
                ld $a0, table + 4($a1)
        </pre>
        <p>The assembler would translate this instruction into the instructions </p>
        <pre>
        lui $at, 4096
        addu $at, $at, $a1
        lw $a0, 8($at)
        </pre>
        <p>The first instruction loads the upper bits of the label’s address into register
        $at, which is the register that the assembler reserves for its own use. The
        second instruction adds the contents of register $a1 to the label’s partial
        address. Finally, the load instruction uses the hardware address mode to add
        the sum of the lower bits of the label’s address and the offset from the original
        instruction to the value in register $at.</p>

        <h3><a name="encoding">Encoding MIPS Instructions</a></h3>
        <p><b>Figure 10.2 explains how a MIPS instruction is encoded in a binary number.</b>
        Each column contains instruction encodings for a field (a contiguous group of
        bits) from an instruction. The numbers at the left margin are values for a field.
        For example, the j opcode has a value of 2 in the opcode field. The text at
        the top of a column names a field and specifies which bits it occupies in an
        instruction. For example, the op field is contained in bits 26–31 of an instruction.
        This field encodes most instructions. However, some groups of instructions use
        additional fields to distinguish related instructions. For example, the different
        floating-point instructions are specified by bits 0–5. The arrows from the first
        column show which opcodes use these additional fields.</p>

        <p>The rest of this appendix describes both the instructions implemented by
        actual MIPS hardware and the pseudoinstructions provided by the MIPS assembler.
        The two types of instructions are easily distinguished. Actual instructions

        Register specifiers begin with an <i>r,</i> so the next field is a 5-bit register

        map.</b> The values of each field are shown to its left. The first column shows
        the values in base 10 and the second shows base 16 for the op field (bits 31
        to 26) in the third column. This op field completely specifies the MIPS operation
        except for 6 op values: 0, 1, 16, 17, 18, and 19. These operations are determined
        by other fields, identified by pointers. The last field (funct) uses “ <b>
        <i>f</i> </b> ” to mean “s” if rs = 16 and op = 17 or “d” if rs = 17 and op =
        17. The second field (rs) uses “ <b><i>z</i> </b> ” to mean “0”, “1”, “2”, or
        “3” if op = 16, 17, 18, or 19, respectively. If rs = 16, the operation is specified
        elsewhere: if <b><i>z</i> </b> = 0, the operations are specified in the fourth
        field (bits 4 to 0); if <b><i>z</i> </b> = 1, then the operations are in the last
        field with <b><i>f</i> </b> = s. If rs = 17 and <b><i>z</i> </b> = 1, then the operations
        are in the last field with <b><i>f</i> </b> = d.</p>
        <p>Pseudoinstructions follow roughly the same conventions, but omit instruction
        encoding information. For example:</p>

        <p>In pseudoinstructions, rdest and rsrc1 are registers and src2 is either a
        register or an immediate value. In general, the assembler and SPIM translate
        a more general form of an instruction (e.g., add $v1, $a0, 0x55) to a specialized
        form (e.g., addi $v1, $a0, 0x55).</p>

        <h3><a name="branch">Branch Instructions</a></h3>
        <p>Branch instructions use a signed 16-bit instruction <i>offset</i> field; hence
        they can jump 2 <sup>15</sup> - <i>instructions</i> (not bytes) forward or
        215 instructions backwards. The <i>jump</i> instruction contains a 26-bit address
        field. In actual MIPS processors, branch instructions are delayed branches,
        which do not transfer control until the instruction following the branch (its
        &quot;delay slot&quot;) has executed (see Chapter 6). Delayed branches affect the offset
        calculation, since it must be computed relative to the address of the delay
        slot instruction (PC + 4), which is when the branch occurs. SPIM does not simulate
        this delay slot, unless the -bare or -delayed_branch flags are specified.
        </p>
        <p>In assembly code, offsets are pnot usually specified as numbers. Instead,
        an instructions branch to a label, and the assembler computes the distance between
        the branch and the target class="instformat" instructions.</p>
        <p>In MIPS32, all actual (not pseudo) conditional branch instructions have a
        &quot;likely&quot; variant (for example, beq’s likely variant is beql), which does <i>
        not</i> execute the instruction in the branch’s delay slot if the branch is not
        taken. Do not use these instructions; they may be removed in subsequent versions
        of the architecture. SPIM implements these instructions, but they are not described
        further.</p>

        <h3><a name="floating">Floating-Point Instructions</a></h3>
        <p>The MIPS has a floating-point coprocessor (numbered 1) that operates on single
        precision (32-bit) and double precision (64-bit) floating-point numbers. This
        coprocessor has its own registers, which are numbered $f0–$f31. Because these
        registers are only 32 bits wide, two of them are required to hold doubles, so
        only floating-point registers with even numbers can hold double precision values.
        The floating-point coprocessor also has 8 condition code ( <i>cc</i> ) flags,
        numbered 0–7, which are set by compare instructions and tested by branch (bc1f
        or bc1t) and conditional move instructions.</p>
        <p>Values are moved in or out of these registers one word (32 bits) at a time
        by lwc1, swc1, mtc1, and  class="instformat"mfc1 instructions or one double (64 bits) at a time
        by ldc1 and sdc1 described above, or pby the l.s, l.d, s.s, and s.d pseudoinstructions
        described below.</p class="instformat">
        <p>In the actual instruct class="instformat"ions below, bits 21–26 are 0 for single precision and
        1 for double precision. In the pseudoinstructions below, fdest is a floating-point
        register (e.g., $f2).</p>

        <h2><a name="concluding">Concluding Remarks</a></h2>
        <p>Programming in assembly language requires a programmer to trade off helpful
        features of high-level languages—such as data structures, type checking, and
        control constructs—for complete control over the instructions that a computer
        executes. External constraints on some applications, such as response time or
        program size, require a programmer to pay close attention to every instruction.
        However, the cost of this level of attention is assembly language programs that
        are longer, more time-consuming to write, and more difficult to maintain than
        high-level language programs.</p>
        <p>Moreover, three trends are reducing the need to write programs in assembly
        language. The first trend is toward the improvement of compilers. Modern compilers
        produce code that is typically comparable to the best handwritten code— and
        is sometimes better. The second trend is the introduction of new processors
        that are not only faster, but in the case of processors that execute multiple
        instructions simultaneously, also more difficult to program by hand. In addition,
        the rapid evolution of the modern computer favors high-level language programs
        that are not tied to a single architecture. Finally, we witness a trend toward
        increasingly complex applications—characterized by complex graphic interfaces
        and many more features than their predecessors. Large applications are written
        by teams of programmers and require the modularity and semantic checking features
        provided by high-level languages.</p>

          <li>[5] &lt;§A.5&gt; Section A.5 described how memory is partitioned on
            most MIPS systems. Propose another way of dividing memory that meets the
            same goals.</li>
          <li>[20] &lt;§A.6&gt; Rewrite the code for fact to use fewer instructions.
          </li>
          <li>[5] &lt;§A.7&gt; Is it ever safe for a user program to use registers
            $k0 or $k1? </li>
          <li>[25] &lt;§A.7&gt; Section A.7 contains code for a very simple exception
            handler. One serious problem with this handler is that it disables interrupts
            for a long time. This means that interrupts from a fast I/O device may be
            lost. Write a better exception handler that is interruptable and enables
            interrupts as quickly as possible.</li>
          <li>[15] &lt;§A.7&gt; The simple exception handler always jumps back to
            the instruction following the exception. This works fine unless the instruction
            that causes the exception is in the delay slot of a branch. In that case,
            the next instruction is the target of the branch. Write a better handler
            that uses the EPC register to determine which instruction should be executed
            after the exception.</li>
          <li>[5] &lt;§A.9&gt; Using SPIM, write and test an adding machine program
            that repeatedly reads in integers and adds them into a running sum. The
            program should stop when it gets an input that is 0, printing out the sum
            at that point.
          </li>
          <li>[5] &lt;§A.9&gt; Using SPIM , write and test a program that reads in
            three integers and prints out the sum of the largest two of the three. You can
            break ties arbitrarily.</li>
          <li>[5] &lt;§A.9&gt; Using SPIM, write and test a program that reads in
            a positive integer using the SPIM system calls. If the integer is not positive,
            the program should terminate with the message “Invalid Entry”; otherwise
            the program should print out the names of the digits of the integers, delimited
            by exactly one space. For example, if the user entered “728,” the output
            would be “Seven Two Eight.” </li>
          <li>[25] &lt;§A.9&gt; Write and test a MIPS assembly language program to
            compute and print the first 100 prime numbers. A number <i>n</i> is prime
            if no numbers except 1 and <i>n</i> divide it evenly. You should implement
            two routines:
            <ul type="square">
              <li>test_prime (n) Return 1 if <i>n</i> is prime and 0 if <i>n </i> is
                not prime.</li>
              <li>main () Iterate over the integers, testing if each is prime. Print
                the first 100 numbers that are prime.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <p>Test your programs by running them on SPIM.</p>
          <li><p>A.10 [10] &lt;§§A.6, A.9&gt;  Using SPIM, write and test a recursive program
              for solving the classic mathematical recreation, the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.
              (This will require the use of stack frames to support recursion.) The puzzle
              consists of three pegs (1, 2, and 3) and <i>n</i> disks (the number <i>n</i>
              can vary; typical values might be in the range from 1 to 8). Disk 1 is smaller
              than disk 2, which is in turn smaller than disk 3, and so forth, with disk
              <i>n</i> being the largest. Initially, all the disks are on peg 1, starting with
              disk <i>n</i> on the bottom, disk <i>n</i> – 1 on top of that, and so forth, up to
              disk 1 on the top. The goal is to move all the disks to peg 2. You may only move one
              disk at a time, that is, the top disk from any of the three pegs onto the top of either
              of the other two pegs. Moreover, there is a constraint: You must not place a larger disk
              on top of a smaller disk.</p>
