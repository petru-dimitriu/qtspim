	<h3>What&#39;s New?</h3>
	<p><i>QtSpim</i> is a new user interface for <em>Spim</em>

 built on the
	<a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt UI framework</a>. Qt is cross-platform, so 
	the same user iterface and same code will run on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS 
	X (yeah!). Moreover, the interface is clean and up-to-date (unlike the archaic 
	X windows interface).</p>
	<p><em>Spim</em>
 has moved to
	<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/">SourceForge</a>! The 
	source code for all version of <em>Spim</em>
 are in an SVN repository and compiled 
	version are available for download. There is also a bug tracker and discussion 
	forum. <em>Spim</em> is an open source project, so please join in and 
	contribute.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="middle">
<p><em>Spim</em>

 is a self-contained simulator that runs MIPS32 programs. It reads 
and executes assembly language programs written for this processor. <em>Spim</em>

 
also provides a simple debugger and minimal set of operating system services. S<i>pim</i> does <span class="style1">
not</span>
 execute binary (compiled) programs.</p>
<p><em>Spim</em>

 implements almost the entire MIPS32 assembler-extended instruction 
set. (It omits most floating point comparisons and rounding modes and the memory 
system page tables.) The MIPS architecture has several variants that differ in various 
ways (e.g., the MIPS64 architecture supports 64-bit integers and addresses), which 
means that <em>Spim</em>

 will not run programs for all MIPS processors.</p>
	<p><em>Spim</em>

    comes with complete source code and documentation.</p>
<p><em>Spim</em>

 implements both a terminal and windows interfaces. On Microsoft Windows, 
Linux, and Mac OS X, the s<em>pim</em>

 program offers a simple terminal interface 
and the <i>QtSpim</i> program provides the windowing interface. The 
<a href="older.html">older 
programs <em>xspim</em> and <em>PCSpim</em></a> provide window interfaces for these 
systems as well.</p>

<h2><a name="qtspim">QtSpim</a></h2>
<p>The newest version of <em>Spim</em>

 is called <i>QtSpim</i>, and unlike all of 
the other version, it runs on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, <span class="style1">and</span> Linux&#8212;the same source code and the same user interface on all three platforms!
<i>QtSpim</i> is the version of <em>Spim</em>

 that currently being actively maintaned. 
The other versions are still available, but please stop using them and move to
<i>QtSpim</i>. It has a modern user interface, extensive help, and is consistent 
across all three platforms. <i>QtSpim </i>makes my life far easier, and will likely 
improve yours and your students&#39; experience as well.</p>
<p>A compiled, immediately installable version of <i>QtSpim</i> is available for
Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and
Linux can be downloaded from:
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/">
https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/</a>.
<a href="http://spimsimulator.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/spimsimulator/">Full source 
code</a> is also available (to compile <i>QtSpim</i>, you need
<a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">the Qt framework</a>, a very nice 
cross-platform UI framework that can be downloaded from
<a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">http://qt-project.org/downloads</a>).</p>
<p><a href="older.html">Older versions of <em>Spim</em></a>, namely <em>PCSpim</em> 
and <em>xspim</em>, are still available and are updated with bug fixes, though 
active development on them is done.</p>

<hr /><h2><a name="birthday">Happy Birthday SPIM!</a></h2>
<p><em>Spim</em>

 turned 20 years old January 2010. I wrote the original version of
<em>Spim</em>

 as the target machine for my first compiler class at University of Wisconsin, 
Madison in the spring semester 1990. <em>Spim</em>

 is likely older than most of the 
students currently using it!</p>
<p>As a birthday present, the 8.0 version of <em>Spim</em>

 has a simpler, less restrictive 
license, namely the standard BSD license.</p>
